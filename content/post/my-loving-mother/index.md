My loving mother, Du Xianling (杜现玲), passed away on September 27, 2022, at the age of 56. She has been fighting lung cancer since last year. We believe that her strong heart, selflessness, and kindness will advance the research frontiers related to cancer treatment.

At the time of diagnosis, she already had multiple metastases (lung, liver, leptomeningeal, bones, etc.); four vertebrae fractured in the thoracic and lumbar spine; intracranial hypertension, with diplopia, strabismus, epilepsy, etc., appeared one after another.

From the beginning of treatment, she was at the end of her rope, and there was no cure or medicine available. Even with the most aggressive treatments, the survival period was only 4 to 7 weeks.

She gave me unconditional trust and tried many experimental therapies around the world. Some were still in clinical trials, while some were even before phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.

Thanks to her courage, my mother performed a miracle and obtained high quality of life for almost one year. She enjoyed the last part of her life to the fullest, facing each day with optimism and singing about every bit of beauty in her life.

Her courage also leaves the world with highly-valuable clinical data and treatment experience, which can accelerate related clinical research and have a great potential to bring a life-changing opportunity for some patients with similar driver genes.

Together with our friends in the medical community, I will do my best to contribute these data and records to the academic community. May my mother's experience benefit humanity, and may her courage, kindness, and selflessness bring blessings to the world.

I love you so much, Mom. You've done such a wonderful job, fighting our evil enemy. I will always miss you. I will continue to work hard in the field of AI and medical imaging. I will do everything I can to save lives for the rest of my life. Please rest in peace.
