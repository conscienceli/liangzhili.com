abstract: "With the proliferation of mobile devices, crowdsensing has become an appealing technique to collect and process big data. Meanwhile, the rise of fifth generation wireless systems, especially the new cellular base stations with computing ability, brings about the revolutionary edge computing. Although many approaches regarding the mobile crowdsensing have emerged in the last few years, very few of them are focused on the combination of edge computing and crowdsensing. In this paper, we adopt the state-of-the-art edge computing method to solve the crowdsensing problem with the real-time sensing data, and more importantly, make human be in the loop again, in order to respect the usersâ€™ willing and privacy. A distributed deep learning model is adopted to extract features from the captured data, which is not only a compression process to reduce the communication cost, but an encryption procedure for safety protection. The proposed model enables the crowdsensing system to fully harness the computing capacity of edge nodes and devices, and obtain a strong data analysis ability to process the captured data. Simulations demonstrate that our approach is robust and efficient, and outperforms other strategies in several related tasks."
