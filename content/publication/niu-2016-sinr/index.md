abstract: "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a more and more important issue. Energy efficiency, one of the crucial performance indices, is always considered for design of protocols and algorithms in WSNs. In this paper, we focus on data frame transmission under SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio) model. An efficient mechanism, called as SINR-Q-CSMA, is proposed. SINR-Q-CSMA combines dual-channel with time slotted methods, and considers sink circle and regular circle according to different scenarios, which can avoid collision problem effectively. Further, SINR-Q-CSMA employs a solution based on queue length to solve the collision."
