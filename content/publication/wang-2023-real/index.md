abstract: 'Estimating the surgery length has the potential to be utilized as skill assessment, surgical training, or efficient surgical facility utilization especially if it is done in real-time as a remaining surgery duration (RSD). Surgical length reflects a certain level of efficiency and mastery of the surgeon in a well-standardized surgery such as cataract surgery. In this paper, we design and develop a real-time RSD estimation method for cataract surgery that does not require manual labeling and is transferable with minimum fine-tuning.'
